# Python_Hacker_News_Data

**Project Description:**

In this project, I will work with a dataset of submissions to a popular technology site - Hacker News. Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship, run by Paul Graham's investment fund and startup incubator, Y Combinator. Hacker News is similar to reddit, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

There are two main pages on this site: "Ask HN" and "Show HN". Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, while users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project or a product.

The mission of this project is to explore data on Ask HN posts and Show HN posts to find out:

1. Which type of posts receives more comments on average.
2. What is the best time of a day to create a post that would most likely to receive more comments on average.
